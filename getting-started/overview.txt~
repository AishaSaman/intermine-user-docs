Overview
========

InterMine has been in development for over 10 years, and during this time, based on user demand, we have introduced a large number of features. These range from faceted filtering options and enabling Boolean logic and set operations, to table sorting and filtering, a range of standardised export options, integration of other tools such as Cytoscape.


The InterMine Advanced Search is an interface providing a suite of tools for analysis of your data.  The tools range from a simple quicksearch to more advanced analysis of lists of data and advanced data searches. 
The key features include:

 * Quick Search: type in any identifier, name, symbol or keyword to see what's in the database.
 * Template Searches: 'canned' queries that provide a simple form to perform a specific task. You can create your own templates if you log in.
 * QueryBuilder: lets you create custom queries and edit existing templates.
 * Lists: let you operate on whole lists of data at once. You can upload lists or save them from results tables. We also create useful public lists for everyone to use.
 * List Analysis:  Provides a number of pre-configured analysis tools for lists of items, such as GO term enrichment and gene expression graphs.
 * MyMine lets you create an account to save your own queries, lists and templates, as well as marking public templates as favourites.

All these features are accessible from the toolbar on every InterMine page:
