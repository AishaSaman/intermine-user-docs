Exercise7: Query Builder
-----------------------------

Using HumanMine:  we will build a query to show Human genes and 
associated OMIM diseases, and then add a further constraint to show genes associated with all types of Diabetes. 

**1. Start your query from Gene.**

**2. Constrain “Organism” to Homo Sapiens.**

**3. Add the columns of data we want in our results:**

    Gene:  Primary identifier and Symbol
    Disease: name

**4. Run this search - ‘Show results’.**

**5. Return to the query (Use the “Trail” in the top left) and add a constraint to Disease name for “CONTAINS Diabetes”.**

**6. Run the search and save the set of genes.**
