Regulatory data
============


How do I find which transcription factors have been shown to regulate my gene(s)?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The following template will return all types of regulatory region that have been mapped for your gene:


`Gene → Regulatory elements <http://www.flymine.org/query/template.do?name=Gene_RegulatoryRegion&scope=all>`_


For a specific type of regulatory region you can :ref:`filters`. The fifth column of the results (sequence ontology term.name) provides the type of regulatory region.


The following template searches specifically for transcription factor binding sites and gives the factor which binds the site:


`Gene → Transcription Factors <http://www.flymine.org/query/template.do?name=Gene_transcriptionFactors&scope=all>`_


Can I create a list of other genes known to be regulated by this/these transcription factors?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Yes, use the following template:


`TranscriptionFactor → Genes which have binding sites for this factor <http://www.flymine.org/query/template.do?name=TranscriptionFactor_Genes&scope=all>`_




How do I find the sequence of the binding sites?
----------------------------------------------------------------


The templates `Gene → Regulatory elements <http://www.flymine.org/query/template.do?name=Gene_RegulatoryRegion&scope=all>`_
and `Gene → Transcription Factors <http://www.flymine.org/query/template.do?name=Gene_transcriptionFactors&scope=all>`_ both include the sequence of the binding site in their results.  For other templates you can add the sequence field if necessary (see :ref:`resultsadddata`).  You need to look for the class **Sequence** and add the field called **Residues**.


Other regulatory region searches
--------------------------------------------


FlyMine includes many other templates for searching regulatory data, including searching within a specified chromosomal region and searching within gene flanking regions.  To view all regulatory templates, go to the templates page and filter the list for **Regulation**:
