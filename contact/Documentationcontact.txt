Each InterMine database will have it’s own help support email.  For FlyMine, metabolicMine and humanMine please use:


* FlyMine:  support@flymine.org
* MetabolicMine/HumanMine:  support@metabolicmine.org


Each page within the interface has a link to a contact form.  You can use this for any problem, but if you are having problems constructing a query, this form will automatically append the query you are working on for us to look at.
