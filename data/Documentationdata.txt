The Data tab
------------------


Most InterMine instances include a ‘Data’ or ‘Data sources’ tab which provides details of all data included in the database.  In most cases this will include details of data versions or the date that the data was retrieved and a link to the original database or source.  A section of the FlyMine data sources tab is shown below:

Data in the database
----------------------------


Within the database the source of all data is stored in the data source and data set classes.  The data source stores the main data provider (eg a database) and the data set is any individual sets of data from that data source.  For example, an InterMine may load Gene Ontology data for several organisms from the Gene Ontology Consortium.  The data source is the Gene Ontology Consortium, while the data for each organism will be recorded as a data set.  Data sets and data sources can be included in the results of queries.  This is particularly useful if the same type of data is loaded from different sources.  For example, FlyMine loads interaction data from both Intact and BioGrid:
