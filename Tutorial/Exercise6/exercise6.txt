Exercise6: Using template searches
-----------------------------

Use HumanMine for this exercise.

In our exploration of the PPARG gene we could see that it is Up-regulated in 
adipose tissue. Use the template searches in HumanMine to answer the following 
questions:


**1. What other genes are up-regulated in adipose tissue according 
to the array express dataset (E-MTAB-62)?  Don't forget to add a filter for “UP” expression. Save a list of these genes.** 

**Note:** The E-MTAB-62 dataset is a human gene expression atlas of 5372 samples representing 369 different cell and tissue types, disease states and cell lines

**2. Do any of the genes identified in 1. interact with PPARG? Save a list
of these genes.**

**1. What other genes are up-regulated in adipose tissue according to the Array express dataset?  Don't forget to add a filter for “UP” expression. 
Save a list of these genes.**


Find the following template and set “Condition = Adipose tissue”

Filter the column “Atlas Expression.Expression” for “UP”
“Save as List” : Atlas Expression > Gene.  You should have a list of 1, 654 genes

**2. Do any of the genes identified in 1. interact with PPARG? Save a list of these genes.**
